# Description 
This application is a React.js user interface which connects to an API at the endpoint /api/.

For development purposes, I've set up the React.js development proxy which redirects /api/ calls to https://counters-dot-sse-2019.appspot.com/

# Installation
1. Install Node.js
2. git 'clone https://github.com/austcollins/React.js-UI.git'
3. 'run npm install'
